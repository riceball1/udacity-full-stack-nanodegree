**Lesson 5: Build a CRUD APp with SQLAlchemy**

Prereq:
- Install flask, python3, pip3
- psql is needed to pull data
- sqlalchemy is needed to query from the dbapi

## Things I learned
- Flask uses jinga template underneath to help consume data in html
- SQLAlchemy reduces the need to write raw sql 

## Troubleshooting
- Issue with flask not showing up in vscode 
`Import "flask" could not be resolved from sourcePylancereportMissingModuleSource`
